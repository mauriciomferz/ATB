We will implement a centralised Agent Tool Broker to act as the single enforcement boundary
between all agentic AI platforms and enterprise systems.
No agent ever accesses a system directly. Every action is authenticated, authorised, constrained,
and audited through the broker, transforming chaos into controlled, safe autonomy.

Enabling Al Autonomy, Responsibly
This architecture enables our enterprise to safely adopt agentic AI by fundamentally separating identity
from authority. AI agents will authenticate via their native platforms, but all sensitive actions will be
brokered, policy-checked, and cryptographically authorised using short-lived AgentAuth mandates.
Internally, SPIFFE ensures a true zero-trust foundation without static secrets. The result is scalable, cross-
platform AI autonomy that is auditable, legally defensible, and operationally safe. This is how we innovate
with confidence.
